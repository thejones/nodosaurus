# nodosaurus: A Hapi API

![alt tag](http://www.dinosaurjungle.com/greenst_nodosaurus.jpg)

## Why?
I wanted a project that was ready to go when I have a great idea. I also wanted to create a learning tool for others to check out. Nodosaurus is that vision.

## What's inside

* Hapi
* Hapi ecosystem (lab, good, boom, etc)
* MongoDB + mongoose
* Postgres/PostGIS + Massive
* Auth0 - Why deal with this anymore?
* Basic Stripe implementation. (Based on Node Stripe example but uses Checkout on the client side.)
* Vue.js is targeted for the 1.0 release. Aurelia is used for pre-release tags.

## Coming soon

 * This project is currently being redeveloped and updated.
 * ES6/ES7 (Async/Await handlers)
 * Better organization
 * Server hosts client app (less deps to get going)


## Getting started

* Wait for the 1.0 release.
* Need data?
